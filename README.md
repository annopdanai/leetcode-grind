## Leetcode ~~Blind 75~~ Grind (by someone who almost failed a DSA course)
Ah yes, Leetcode ~~Blind 75~~ grind from someone who almost failed a DSA course

UPDATE: Now it's just a repo for me to grind leetcode but mainly focus on Blind 75 and NeetCode 150.

## Why this repo? ðŸ¤”
Have you ever seen those "Golang solution 0ms" or "Golang solution faster than 100%" that you have no idea what they're doing when you see their solution? Well, that's relatable.

Being someone who barely passed a DSA course. All of the code here are **as simple as possible** while still having somewhat decent efficiency.

Yeah, I know this is definitely not the best Blind 75 you will ever see. My code will mostly be completely blown away by most of the solution that you've seen on internet.
